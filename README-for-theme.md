## Usage

Run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved.

### Reformat code

Run `npm run prettier` which enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
Prettier can be run [in your editor](http://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) on-save, in a [pre-commit hook](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html), or in [CI environments](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html#list-different) to ensure your codebase has a consistent style without devs ever having to post a nit-picky comment on a code review ever again!

### Production build

Run `npm run build` which will compile Sass, JS, optimized all our assets, and copied the necessary files into the `dist` folder.
